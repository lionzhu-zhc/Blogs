# Automated Melanoma Recognition in dermoscopy images via very deep residual networks
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; IEEE TMI 2017.04
## Introduction
### Challenge:
1. color, texture,shape, size and location in the dermoscopy images as well as the high degree of visual similarity between melanoma and non-melanoma lesions 
2. low contrasts and obscure boundaries between skin lesions
3. presence of artifacts 

### Existing methods:
1. low-level hand-crafted features, select features and combine features
> these hand-crafted features are incapable of dealing with the huge intraclass variation of melanoma and the high degree
of visual similarity between melanoma and non-melanoma
